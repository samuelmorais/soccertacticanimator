# Soccer Tactic 3D Animator
Soccer tactic 3D animation engine made with Unity using Design Patterns.

This project was started a few years ago and was coded before I started to study Clean Architecture.

The idea was to use Design Patterns and it was achieved with the use of State, MVC, Factory and Repository patterns.

Some private assets were not included because were bought from the Asset Store.

The next step is to Develop the Domain Layer. One studied possibility is to use Javascript as the Core, using JINT to decouple the Business Logic from the Unity Framework, in a way that this app can be ported for other Engines, if needed or wanted.
